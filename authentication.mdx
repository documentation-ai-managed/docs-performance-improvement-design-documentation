## Authentication Methods

Performance Improvement Design supports multiple authentication methods to ensure secure access while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Key Authentication" icon="key">
    <Expandable title="Getting Your API Key" default-open="true">
      Navigate to your account settings and generate a new API key. Store it securely as it provides full access to your documentation workspace.
    </Expandable>
    <Expandable title="Using API Keys" default-open="false">
      Include the API key in the Authorization header for all API requests.
      
      <CodeGroup tabs="cURL,JavaScript">
        ```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here" https://api.performance-docs.com/v1/docs
```
        ```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.performance-docs.com/v1/docs', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
  }
});
```
      </Expandable>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OAuth Integration" icon="shield">

      <Step title="Register Application" icon="plus">
        Register your application in the developer console to obtain client credentials.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Request Authorization" icon="user-check">
        Direct users to the authorization endpoint to grant permissions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Exchange Code" icon="refresh-cw">
        Exchange the authorization code for an access token.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Team Access" icon="users">
    <Expandable title="Role-Based Permissions" default-open="true">
      Assign roles like Admin, Editor, or Viewer to control access levels within your workspace.
    </Expandable>

## Token Management

Proper token lifecycle management is crucial for maintaining security and preventing unauthorized access.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access Tokens" icon="lock" href="#access-tokens">
    Short-lived tokens for API access with automatic expiration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refresh Tokens" icon="refresh-cw" href="#refresh-tokens">
    Long-lived tokens used to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Best Practices

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Secure Storage" default-open="true">
    Never store API keys or tokens in version control. Use environment variables or secure key management services.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Token Rotation" default-open="false">
    Regularly rotate tokens and revoke compromised credentials immediately.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Rate Limiting" default-open="false">
    Implement proper rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="alert">If you suspect your credentials have been compromised, revoke them immediately and generate new ones.</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

Common authentication issues and their solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid API Key | Verify the key hasn't expired and is correctly formatted |
| Permission Denied | Check your role assignments and workspace permissions |
| Token Expired | Use refresh token to obtain new access token |
