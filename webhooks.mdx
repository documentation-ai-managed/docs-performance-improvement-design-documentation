## Setting Up Webhooks

Configure webhooks to start receiving event notifications from your workspace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Endpoint" icon="server">
    Set up an HTTPS endpoint in your application to receive webhook payloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Webhook" icon="plus">
    Add your endpoint URL in the webhook settings panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Events" icon="settings">
    Select which events you want to receive notifications for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Integration" icon="check-circle">
    Send test events to verify your endpoint is working correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">Ensure your webhook endpoint uses HTTPS and can handle POST requests with JSON payloads.</Callout>

## Available Events

Subscribe to specific events to receive targeted notifications.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Content Events" icon="file-text">

    </Expandable>
    <Expandable title="API Rate Limit" default-open="false">
      Warns when approaching API rate limits.
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Webhook Payloads

Understanding the structure of webhook payloads helps you process events correctly.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Payload Structure" default-open="true">
    All webhook payloads follow a consistent JSON structure with event type, timestamp, and relevant data.
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="JSON,TypeScript">
      ```json
{
  "event": "document.updated",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "workspace": "your-workspace-id",
  "data": {
    "document_id": "doc-123",
    "title": "API Reference",
    "updated_by": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```
      ```typescript
interface WebhookPayload {
  event: string;
  timestamp: string;
  workspace: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
}
```
    </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Security Verification" default-open="false">
    Verify webhook authenticity using HMAC signatures to prevent spoofing attacks.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">Always validate webhook signatures to ensure the payload originates from Performance Improvement Design.</Callout>

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for reliable webhook integrations.

| Practice | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Idempotent Processing | Handle duplicate events gracefully |
| Error Handling | Implement retry logic for failed deliveries |
| Rate Limiting | Respect API limits and implement throttling |

<Expandable title="Advanced Patterns" default-open="false">
  Use webhooks for complex workflows like automated testing, content synchronization, and notification systems.
</Expandable>

## Troubleshooting

Common webhook issues and solutions:

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Delivery Failures" default-open="true">
    Check endpoint availability, SSL certificates, and network connectivity.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Invalid Payloads" default-open="false">
    Verify your parsing logic handles all event types and data structures.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Rate Limiting" default-open="false">
    Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="alert">Webhook deliveries are retried up to 5 times with exponential backoff before being marked as failed.</Callout>
